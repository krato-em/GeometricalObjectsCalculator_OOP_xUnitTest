Aim of this project was to practise Test Driven Development.

This console application calculates: 
  - area and circumference for 2D objects (circle, rectangular, square)
  - surface area and volume for 3D objects (block, cube, sphere)

All methods within every class are covered by xUnit tests

As a part of a refactoring practise, modifications were made to each class to follow "don't repeat yourself" (DRY) principle
  - these modifications are stored in 'dryPrincipleFollowed' branch
